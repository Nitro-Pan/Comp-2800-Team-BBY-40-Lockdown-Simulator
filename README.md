# Lockdown Simulator

### Need to haves

Make sure you have Unity 2019.3.10f1 installed, as this project was built in it. Other versions of Unity might work but are untested and unsupported.

You will need to set up a Firebase Database and link it to your project, find out [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/unity/setup)

Unity should automatically set up everything you need otherwise.

If you are unable to build the project, navigate to Edit > Preferences > External Tools and make sure all the slashes in the dependencies are all using forward slashes.

### Importing the Project

The easiest way to import the project is to open up [Unity Hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download) and add the Lockdown Simulator folder within the git repo.
